This is a module for perl 5 that allows easy xbase like access to xbase DBF
files and Foxpro IDX (index) and FPT (memo) files.

To install this module. Make sure you are in the directory that this README
file is in and type:

	perl Makefile.PL
	make install

*********************************************************
*** USERS OF OLD VERSIONS PLEASE NOTE THE NAME CHANGE ***
*** You will have to modify existing scripts to use   ***
*** Xbase instead of xbase.                           ***
*********************************************************

This name change was done to make it consistent with the naming
convention for perl modules in the Modules List.

If you want to install the module in a private directory then take a look
at the documentation to find out how.

The documentation for Xbase is in the Xbase.pm file itself. You can use
pod2man or pod2html that come with perl to generate the format you like.

	pod2man Xbase.pm > Xbase.man

		-or-

	pod2html Xbase.pm > Xbase.html

The install step above installs the man page automatically.

I have included a "Powered by Xbase.pm" logo (xbasei.gif) that you
might find amusing. Use it at your web sites if you use the
module. :-)
